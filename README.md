# Kanisa Digital
A web app where Christians can access Christian content such as:
- Books (audiobooks too)
- Music
- Movies
- Sermons
- Podcasts
- Articles/blogs
- Youtube-style videos

Basically this app would be a Christian alternative of Youtube, Netflix, Medium, Audible and Spotify all rolled into one.
